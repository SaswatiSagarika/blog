<b>Harry Houdini</b> (born Erik Weisz, later Ehrich Weiss or Harry Weiss; March 24, 1874 â€“ October
31, 1926) was a Hungarian-American illusionist and stunt performer,
noted for his sensational escape acts.He first attracted notice in vaudeville in the US and then
as "Harry Handcuff Houdini" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged 
police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains,
ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjackets under water, and having to escape 
from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it.
In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special handcuffs commissioned by
London's Daily Mirror, keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw
him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state
of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini
presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of
American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent
artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.
Houdini made several movies, but quit acting when it failed to bring in money. He was
also a keen aviator, and aimed to become the first man to fly a plane in Australia.
